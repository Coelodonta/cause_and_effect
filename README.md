# cause_and_effect
Experimenting with the simplest thing that could possibly work for causality.

This is a very simple tool written in Python 3 and MySQL for exploring relationships between causes and effects.


It uses a small sample of about 7,000 entities and their relationships that were downloaded from WikiData (https://www.wikidata.org).


# Description of the files:
- cae0query.py : The main program written in Python
- cae0_dump.sql - MySQL database dump with the entities and relationships
- crudomatic_procedures.sql - MySQL stored procedures for the database generated by crudomatic (https://github.com/Coelodonta/crudomatic)

# Usage examples:

Finding causes:
```
$ ./cae0query.py C lob
Finding Effects containing the phrase "lob"..
       Effects:
1. campylobacter fetus infectious disease
2. campylobacteriosis
3. cordylobia anthropophaga  myiasis
4. diphyllobothriasis
5. frontal lobe disorder
6. lobito air disaster
7. lobomycosis
8. reactions to global surveillance disclosures
Select the Effect (1-8):

5
Causes of frontal lobe disorder:
-> lobotomy  (Relationship: has effect)

```
```
$ ./cae0query.py C merc
Finding Effects containing the phrase "merc"..
       Effects:
1. exposure to mercury alkyl compounds
2. merciful anosmia
3. mercurial erythema
4. mercury poisoning
5. perchloromethyl mercaptan exposure
Select the Effect (1-5):

4
Causes of mercury poisoning:
-> mercury  (Relationship: has effect)

```

 Finding effects:

```
$ ./cae0query.py E lob
Finding Causes containing the phrase "lob"..
       Causes:
1. campylobacter
2. campylobacter jejuni

6. diphyllobothrium hians
7. diphyllobothrium latum
8. frontal lobe disorder
9. global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)
10. lobotomy
11. megaloblastic anemia
12. waldenström's macroglobulinemia
Select the Cause (1-12):

10
Effects of lobotomy:
-> frontal lobe disorder  (Relationship: has cause)
-> -> bruns ataxia  (Relationship: has cause)

```
```
$ ./cae0query.py E merc
Finding Causes containing the phrase "merc"..
       Causes:
1. 2-mercaptoimidazoline
2. cetyl mercaptan
3. cyclohexyl mercaptan
4. dodecyl mercaptan
5. mercury
6. mercury alkyl compounds
7. mercury poisoning
8. methyl mercaptan
9. nonyl mercaptan
10. perchloromethylmercaptan
11. propyl mercaptan
Select the Cause (1-11):

5
Effects of mercury:
-> mercury poisoning  (Relationship: has cause)
-> -> acrodynia  (Relationship: has cause)
-> -> erethism  (Relationship: has cause)
-> -> mercurial erythema  (Relationship: has cause)
