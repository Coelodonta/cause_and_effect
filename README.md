# cause_and_effect
Experimenting with the simplest thing that could possibly work for causality.

This is a very simple tool for exploring relationships between causes and effects.


It uses a small sample of about 7,000 entities and their relationships that were downloaded from WikiData (https://www.wikidata.org).


# Description of the files:
- cae0query.py : The main program
- cae0_dump.sql - MySQL database dump with the entities and relationships
- crudomatic_procedures.sql - Stored procedures for the database generated by crudomatic (https://github.com/Coelodonta/crudomatic)

# Usage examples:

Finding causes:
